        <p>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun, with a surface that experiences extreme temperature swings. During the day, temperatures can soar to about 430째C (800째F), but at night, they drop to as low as -180째C (-290째F). Despite being so close to the Sun, Mercury has no significant atmosphere to retain heat, leading to these drastic shifts.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The planet&apos;s surface is covered with craters and ridges, similar to our Moon, a testament to its ancient history of impacts. Mercury also has a weak magnetic field, which is surprising for a small planet with a slow rotation. Although it&apos;s barren and inhospitable, Mercury&apos;s resilience to the Sun&apos;s harsh environment provides scientists with valuable insights into the formation and evolution of rocky planets.</p>
